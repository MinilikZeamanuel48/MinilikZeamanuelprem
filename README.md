The Top 6 Premier League Table

Introduction-
Hey there! I'm thrilled to provide you with my first ever project, the Top 6 Premier League Table. 
As a football fan and a die-hard Liverpool fan, I was inspired to develop this project to look into my favourite team's performance and find out where they rank among the top 6 teams in the Premier League for two
consecutive seasons: 2021/22 and 2022/23.

Project Details-
The project centres around portraying the Premier League standings in a tabular manner. The table focuses on the top six clubs, providing us with the matches played, amount of wins, amount of draws, amount of loses, goals for, goals against, goal difference and the amount of points. 

My Motivation-
As a football enthusiast, it was only natural for me to turn my interest into a coding project. 
I was curious to see how Liverpool did in the Premier League during the 2021/22 and 2022/23 seasons because they are my favourite team.
The initiative provided me with the opportunity to see Liverpool's great performance in the 2021/22 season, during which they gained an excellent place among the top clubs. 
However, in the subsequent season, Liverpool faced some struggles, and their ranking slipped. This motivated me to analyze and compare their performance against other top-tier clubs.
By creating this Premier League Table, I was able to merge my love for soccer, my passion for Liverpool, and my interest in coding. 
It was a rewarding experience to gather and present the data in an organized and visually appealing manner.

Please bear in mind that the table presented here is simply an example; in an actual project, the data would be dynamically created and constantly updated to reflect the most recent rankings in real-time.
I hope you enjoy this project as much as I did!
