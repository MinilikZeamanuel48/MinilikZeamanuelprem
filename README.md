Premier League Table

Introduction-
Hey there! I'm excited to share with you my first-ever project, the Premier League Table. 
As a soccer enthusiast and a die-hard Liverpool fan, I was motivated to create this project to delve into the performance of my favorite team and see where they stood among the top six teams in the Premier League for two consecutive seasons: 2021/22 and 2022/23.

Project Details-
The project revolves around displaying the Premier League standings in a tabular format and The table focuses on the top six teams, giving us a snapshot of their performance.

Table Structure-
Here's a glimpse of the table structure:

My Motivation-
Being a passionate soccer fan, it was only natural for me to channel my enthusiasm into a coding project. 
With Liverpool being my favorite team, I was eager to see how they fared in the Premier League during the 2021/22 and 2022/23 seasons.
The project allowed me to witness Liverpool's incredible performance in the 2021/22 season, where they secured an impressive position among the top teams. 
However, in the subsequent season, Liverpool faced some struggles, and their ranking slipped. This motivated me to analyze and compare their performance against other top-tier clubs.
By creating this Premier League Table, I was able to merge my love for soccer, my passion for Liverpool, and my interest in coding. 
It was a rewarding experience to gather and present the data in an organized and visually appealing manner.

Please keep in mind that the table provided here is just a sample representation, and in an actual project, the data would be dynamically generated and continuously updated to reflect the latest standings in real-time.
I hope you find this project as exciting as I did!
